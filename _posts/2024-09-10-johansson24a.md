abstract: A regressor with reject option may refrain from making predictions expected
  to be inaccurate. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate conformal regression
  with reject option. Consistent with standard conformal regression, non-rejected
  predictions are valid prediction intervals. The suggested approach utilizes Mondrian
  conformal regression, where the categories are dynamically created from difficulty
  estimations of individual instances and requested rejection levels. As shown in
  the experiments, using $16$ publicly available data sets and random forests as underlying
  models, the conformal regressors produced progressively tighter intervals for higher
  rejection levels, thus demonstrating the trade-off between coverage and informativeness
  targeted when adding a reject option. A key property of the novel method is the
  fact that the informativeness, i.e., the interval sizes, resulting from any combination
  of significance and rejection levels is known to the user before making any test
  predictions. While all four different difficulty estimators evaluated led to consistently
  tighter intervals for higher rejection levels, the one producing the most efficient
  conformal regressors utilized the disagreement between the trees in the Random forest.
