abstract: Conformal prediction offers a practical framework for distribution-free
  uncertainty quantification, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees under relatively
  mild assumptions on data exchangeability. However, these assumptions cease to hold
  for time series due to their temporally correlated nature. In this work, we present
  a novel use of conformal prediction for time series forecasting that incorporates
  time series decomposition. This approach allows us to model different temporal components
  individually. By applying specific conformal algorithms to each component and then
  merging the obtained prediction intervals, we customize our methods to account for
  the different exchangeability regimes underlying each component. Our decomposition-based
  approach is thoroughly discussed and empirically evaluated on synthetic and real-world
  data. We find that the method provides promising results on well-structured time
  series, but can be limited by factors such as the decomposition step for more complex
  data.
