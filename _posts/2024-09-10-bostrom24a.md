abstract: "\\verb|crepes| is a Python package for conformal prediction, which has
  been extended in several ways since its introduction. While the original version
  of the package focused on conformal regressors and predictive systems, the current
  version also includes conformal classifiers. New classes and methods for computing
  non-conformity scores and Mondrian categories have also been incorporated. Moreover,
  the package has been extended to allow for seamless embedding of classifiers and
  regressors in the conformal prediction framework; instead of generating conformal
  predictors that are separate from the learners, the latter can now be equipped with
  specific prediction methods that in addition to providing point predictions also
  can generate p-values, prediction sets and intervals, as well as conformal predictive
  distributions. Extensive documentation for the package has furthermore been developed.
  In this paper, these extensions are described, as implemented in \\verb|crepes|,
  version 0.7.0."
