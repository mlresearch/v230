abstract: This paper establishes the asymptotic uniqueness of long-term probability
  forecasts in the following form. Consider two forecasters who repeatedly issue probability
  forecasts for the infinite future. The main result of the paper says that either
  at least one of the two forecasters will be discredited or their forecasts will
  converge in total variation. This can be regarded as a game-theoretic version of
  the classical Blackwell–Dubins result getting rid of some of its limitations. This
  result is further strengthened along the lines of Richard Jeffrey’s radical probabilism.
