abstract: Thanks to their theoretically proven properties, Shapley values have received
  a lot of attention as a means to explain predictions within the area of explainable
  machine learning. However, the computation of Shapley values is time-consuming and
  computationally expensive, in particular for datasets with high dimensionality,
  often rendering them impractical for generating timely explanations. Methods to
  approximate Shapley values, e.g., FastSHAP, offer a solution with adequate computational
  cost. However, such approximations come with a degree of uncertainty. Therefore,
  we propose a method to measure the fidelity of Shapley value approximations and
  use the conformal prediction framework to provide validity guarantees for the whole
  explanation in contrast to an earlier approach that offered validity guarantees
  on a per-feature importance basis, disregarding the relative importance of the remaining
  feature scores within the same explanation. We propose a set of difficulty estimation
  functions devised to consider the difficulty of explanation approximations. We provide
  a large-scale empirical investigation where the proposed difficulty estimators are
  evaluated with respect to their efficiency (interval size) in measuring the similarity
  to the ground truth Shapley values. The results suggest that the proposed approach
  can provide predictions coupled with informative validity guarantees (tight intervals),
  allowing the user to trust/reject the provided explanations based on their similarity
  to the ground truth values.
