abstract: Venn-Abers predictors offer a distribution-free probabilistic framework
  that generates calibrated predictions from the outputs of scoring classifiers, relying
  on minimal assumptions about the data distribution. This paper explores the extension
  of this framework from classification to regression, producing predictive distributions.
  We show how to evaluate the efficacy of the framework by comparing various metrics
  that assess the accuracy and informativeness of the predictions. We also show that
  the framework can be used for real-time prediction, using datasets from predictive
  maintenance and energy consumption forecasting.
