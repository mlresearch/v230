abstract: Deep learning solutions for image classification are more and more widespread
  and sophisticated today, bringing the necessity to properly address their reliability.
  Many approaches exist in uncertainty quantification, and, among these, conformal
  prediction is one of most solid and well-established frameworks. In this paper,
  we study another approach, defined as deep probabilistic scaling, based on the notion
  of scalable classifiers, combined with probabilistic scaling from order statistics.
  Given a pre-trained neural network for (binary) image classification and a target
  class on which it is desirable to control the error, this method is able to bound
  that error to a user-defined level ($\varepsilon$). The method individuates probabilistic
  safety regions of target class samples correctly predicted in high probability.
  We show how the proposed method links with conformal prediction, discussing analogies
  and differences. By considering a (binary) convolutional neural network classifier,
  experiments on several benchmark datasets show a good overall performance of the
  methodology in controlling false negatives.
