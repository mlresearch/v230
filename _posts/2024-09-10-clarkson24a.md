abstract: Conformal prediction is a non-parametric technique for constructing prediction
  intervals or sets from arbitrary predictive models under the assumption that the
  data is exchangeable. It is popular as it comes with theoretical guarantees on the
  marginal coverage of the prediction sets and the split conformal prediction variant
  has a very low computational cost compared to model training. We study the robustness
  of split conformal prediction in a data contamination setting, where we assume a
  small fraction of the calibration scores are drawn from a different distribution
  than the bulk. We quantify the impact of the corrupted data on the coverage and
  efficiency of the constructed sets when evaluated on clean test points, and verify
  our results with numerical experiments. Moreover, we propose an adjustment in the
  classification setting which we call Contamination Robust Conformal Prediction,
  and verify the efficacy of our approach using both synthetic and real datasets.
