abstract: Multi-label classification is a common challenge in various machine learning
  applications, where a single data instance can be associated with multiple classes
  simultaneously. The current paper proposes a novel tree-based method for multi-label
  classification using conformal prediction and multiple hypothesis testing. The proposed
  method employs hierarchical clustering with labelsets to develop a hierarchical
  tree, which is then formulated as a multiple-testing problem with a hierarchical
  structure. The split-conformal prediction method is used to obtain marginal conformal
  $p$-values for each tested hypothesis, and two hierarchical testing procedures are
  developed based on marginal conformal $p$-values, including a hierarchical Bonferroni
  procedure and its modification for controlling the family-wise error rate. The prediction
  sets are thus formed based on the testing outcomes of these two procedures. We establish
  a theoretical guarantee of valid coverage for the prediction sets through proven
  family-wise error rate control of those two procedures.  We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our method in a simulation study and two real data analysis compared to other
  conformal methods for multi-label classification.
