abstract: Split conformal prediction is a statistical method known for its finite-sample
  coverage guarantees, simplicity, and low computational cost. As such, it is suitable
  for predicting uncertainty regions in time series forecasting. However, in the context
  of multi-horizon forecasting, the current literature lacks conformal methods that
  produce efficient intervals and have low computational cost. Building on the foundation
  of split conformal prediction and one of its most prominent extensions to multi-horizon
  time series forecasting (CF-RNN), we introduce ConForME, a method that leverages
  the time dependence within time series to construct efficient multi-horizon prediction
  intervals with probabilistic joint coverage guarantees. We prove its validity and
  support our claims with experiments on both synthetic and real-world data. Across
  all instances, our method outperforms CF-RNN in terms of mean, min, and max interval
  sizes over the entire prediction horizon, achieving improvements of up to 52%. The
  experiments also suggest that these improvements can be further increased by extending
  the prediction horizon and through hyperparameter optimization.
