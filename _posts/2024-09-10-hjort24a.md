abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a framework for constructing confidence sets
  around predictions from machine learning models with finite sample guarantees with
  few assumptions on both the prediction model and the data. In practice, the construction
  of CP sets typically relies on quantile estimates from an empirical distribution
  of non-conformity scores. When the data set consists of predefined, non-overlapping
  classes such as geographical regions, a common technique for improving the confidence
  sets is to calculate a different quantile for each class. However, the classwise
  quantile estimate suffers from high variance when the number of observations in
  each class is low. To circumvent this, one can share calibration data between classes
  with similar empirical distributions of non-conformity scores to reduce the variance
  of the quantile estimate. We study this approach for the application of house price
  prediction in the Norwegian housing market, where $286$ different municipalities
  serve as the initial classes of the data. We find that clustering together municipalities
  based on non-conformity score distributions, agnostic of the spatial distance between
  them, leads to CP sets that achieve, on average, a lower coverage gap in each municipality,
  in particular for the municipalities with few observations.
