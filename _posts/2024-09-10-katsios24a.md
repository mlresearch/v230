abstract: This preliminary study introduces a Conformal Prediction method for Multi-label
  Classification with a nonconformity measure based on the Mahalanobis distance. The
  Mahalanobis measure incorporates a covariance matrix considering correlations between
  the errors of the underlying classifier on each label. Our experimental results
  show that this approach results in a significant informational efficiency improvement
  over the previously proposed Euclidean Norm nonconformity measure.
