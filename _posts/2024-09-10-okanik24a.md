abstract: In the realm of computational science, metamodels serve as indispensable
  tools for approximating complex systems, facilitating the exploration of scenarios
  where traditional modelling may prove computationally infeasible. However, the inherent
  uncertainties within these metamodels, particularly those driven by Machine Learning
  (ML), necessitate rigorous quantification to ensure reliability and robustness in
  decision-making processes. One alternative of obtaining uncertainty estimates is
  using ML models that have a native notion of uncertainty, such as the Bayesian Neural
  Networks (BNNs), however its repeated sampling necessary to approximate the output
  distribution is computationally demanding and might defeat the purpose of building
  metamodels in the first place. In datasets with multidimensional input space and
  a limited amount of training examples, error estimates provided by BNNs often have
  poor quality. This study explores alternative empirical approaches to uncertainty
  quantification, based on knowledge extraction from output space as opposed to input
  space. Leveraging patterns of magnitude of error committed by the metamodel in output
  space, we obtain significant improvement of adaptivity of prediction intervals,
  both over pure Conformal Prediction (CP) and BNNs. Our findings underscore the potential
  of integrating diverse uncertainty quantification methods to fortify reliability
  of metamodels, highlighting their robust and quantifiable confidence in model predictions.
