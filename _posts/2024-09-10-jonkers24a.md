abstract: Conformal predictive systems (CPS) offer a versatile framework for constructing
  predictive distributions, allowing for calibrated inference and informative decision-making.
  However, their applicability has been limited to scenarios adhering to the independent
  and identically distributed (IID) model assumption. This paper extends CPS to accommodate
  scenarios characterized by covariate shifts. We therefore propose weighted CPS (WCPS),
  akin to weighted conformal prediction (WCP), leveraging likelihood ratios between
  training and testing covariate distributions. This extension enables the construction
  of nonparametric predictive distributions capable of handling covariate shifts.
  We present theoretical underpinnings and conjectures regarding the validity and
  efficacy of WCPS and demonstrate its utility through empirical evaluations on both
  synthetic and real-world datasets. Our simulation experiments indicate that WCPS
  are probabilistically calibrated under covariate shift.
