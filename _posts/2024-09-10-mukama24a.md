abstract: Object detection is an important vision task, and providing statistical
  guarantees around such detections can be of critical importance. So far, most conformal
  bounding box regression approaches do not simultaneously account for heteroscedasticity
  and dependencies between the residuals of each dimension. In this paper, we examine
  the importance of such dependencies and heteroscedasticity in the context of multi-target
  conformal regression, we apply copula-based conformal prediction methods to model
  them and to improve the volume of bounding box prediction regions. We compare these
  methods to the state-of-the-art conformal object detection approaches (on the KITTI
  & the BDD100K autonomous driving benchmarks) and the empirical copula-based method
  shows high-efficiency results that are robust w.r.t. heteroscedasticity and also
  robust w.r.t. the structure of the dependencies.
