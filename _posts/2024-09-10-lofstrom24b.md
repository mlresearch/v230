abstract: This study introduces a method to evaluate synthetic data quality by focusing
  on the exchangeability of real and synthetic datasets. This is done through the
  use of a test martingale, which provides a statistical guarantee of the similarity
  of the synthetic data’s representation of the original data distribution. The method
  was tested on six real-world datasets and their synthetic counterparts, revealing
  that traditional metrics such as statistical similarities and model performance
  may be misleading. The results indicate that the martingale test frequently rejects
  the hypothesis of data exchangeability, underscore the need for more robust evaluation
  methods. The martingale-based evaluation offers a straightforward yet effective
  tool to ensure that synthetic data accurately reflects the original dataset, which
  is essential for effective model training and validation.
