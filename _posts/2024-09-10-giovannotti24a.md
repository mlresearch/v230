abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of predictions made by large language models
  (LLMs) in binary text classification tasks remains a challenge. Calibration, in
  the context of LLMs, refers to the alignment between the model’s predicted probabilities
  and the actual correctness of its predictions. A well-calibrated model should produce
  probabilities that accurately reflect the likelihood of its predictions being correct.
  We propose a novel approach that utilizes the inductive Venn–Abers predictor (IVAP)
  to calibrate the probabilities associated with the output tokens corresponding to
  the binary labels. Our experiments on the BoolQ dataset using the Llama 2 model
  demonstrate that IVAP consistently outperforms the commonly used temperature scaling
  method for various label token choices, achieving well-calibrated probabilities
  while maintaining high predictive quality. Our findings contribute to the understanding
  of calibration techniques for LLMs and provide a practical solution for obtaining
  reliable uncertainty estimates in binary question answering tasks, enhancing the
  interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM predictions.
