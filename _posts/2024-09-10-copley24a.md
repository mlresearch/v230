abstract: Satellites and airborne sensors are critical components of the modern surveillance
  and reconnaissance capability.  A common use case involves the application of object
  detection models to such images in order to rapidly process the large volumes of
  data.  This optimises use of expensive communications channel bandwidth, reduces
  the cognitive load on a human interpreter and accelerates the rate at which intelligence
  can be generated.  However there is a clear need for statements of confidence in
  any predictions in order to provide context and enable trust in model outputs. Our
  work examines the use of conformal prediction approaches to robustly quantify types
  of uncertainty in object detection models applied to aerial and satellite imagery
  for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance use cases.  We investigate measures
  of detection and location uncertainty in a YOLO model and indicate how these may
  be leveraged conformal-wise to provide guarantees on the percentage of objects which
  aren’t detected and the coverage of predicted bounding boxes.  We find that conformal
  approaches provide a simple and effective means to expose the uncertainty in the
  outputs of an object detection model and highlight the utility of this knowledge
  in the intelligence setting.
