abstract: Quantifying predictive uncertainty regarding future electricity demand is
  the main goal of probabilistic load forecasting. A good probabilistic model is often
  identified with forecasted densities that are as concentrated (“sharp”) as possible.
  However, this goal is frequently achieved by sacrificing forecast reliability, i.e.
  the statistical compatibility between forecasted densities and observed frequencies.
  In real-world applications, reliability is the crucial measure of model quality,
  especially when predicting distribution tails. We propose a new methodology for
  probabilistic load forecasting, introducing a novel loss function which allows an
  excellent balance between forecast sharpness and reliability.  We apply the proposed
  modelling approach for predicting the electricity load on a benchmark dataset. Experimental
  results show that the obtained density forecasts are extremely reliable and also
  close to optimal in terms of sharpness and point accuracy.
