abstract: In safety-critical applications, such as medicine and healthcare, decision
  makers are hesitant to deploy machine learning models unless the expected algorithmic
  errors are guaranteed to remain within pre-defined tolerances. However, since ML
  algorithms are statistical in nature, a bounded error cannot be ensured for all
  possible data inputs. To the contrary, practitioners could be provided with an estimate
  of the probability the error exceeds the pre-defined tolerance interval. Thus, they
  will be able to better anticipate high magnitude ML errors and thus manage them
  more effectively. We refer to this as the risk-assessment problem and propose a
  novel solution for it. We propose a conformal prediction approach that translates
  the risk-assessment task into a prediction interval generation problem. The conformal
  prediction approach results in prediction intervals that are guaranteed to contain
  the true target variable with a given probability. Using this coverage property,
  we prove that our risk-assessment approach is conservative i.e., the risk we compute,
  under weak assumptions, is not lower than the true risk resulting from the ML algorithm.
  We focus on regression tasks and computationally study, and compare with other related
  methods, the performance of the proposed method both with and without covariate
  shift. We find that our method offers superior accuracy while being conservative.
