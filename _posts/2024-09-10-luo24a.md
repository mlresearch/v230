abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for constructing prediction
  sets with guaranteed coverage. However, recent studies have shown that integrating
  confidence calibration with CP can lead to a degradation in efficiency. In this
  paper, We propose an adaptive approach that considers the classifier’s uncertainty
  and employs entropy-based reweighting to enhance the efficiency of prediction sets
  for conformal classification. Our experimental results demonstrate that this method
  significantly improves efficiency.
