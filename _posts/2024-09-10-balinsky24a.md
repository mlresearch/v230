abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) serves as a robust framework that quantifies uncertainty
  in predictions made by Machine Learning (ML) models. Unlike traditional point predictors,
  CP generates statistically valid prediction regions, also known as prediction intervals,
  based on the assumption of data exchangeability. Typically, the construction of
  conformal predictions hinges on p-values. This paper, however, ventures down an
  alternative path, harnessing the power of e-test statistics to augment the efficacy
  of conformal predictions by introducing a BB-predictor (bounded from the below predictor).
  The BB-predictor can be constructed under even more lenient assumptions than exchangeability.
