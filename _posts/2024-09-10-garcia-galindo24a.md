abstract: Beyond the standard classification scenario, allowing a classifier to refrain
  from making a prediction under uncertainty can have advantages in safety-critical
  applications, where a mistake may hold great costs. In this paper, we extend previous
  works on the development of classifiers with reject option grounded on the conformal
  prediction framework. Specifically, our work introduces a novel approach for inducing
  multi-class classifiers with reliable accuracy or recall estimates for a given rejection
  rate. We empirically evaluate our suggested approach in six multi-class datasets
  and demonstrate its effectiveness against both calibrated and uncalibrated probabilistic
  classifiers. The results underscore our method’s capability to provide reliable
  error rate estimates, thereby enhancing decision-making processes where erroneous
  predictions bear critical consequences.
