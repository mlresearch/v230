abstract: Active learning has received considerable attention as an approach to obtain
  high predictive performance while minimizing the labeling effort. A central component
  of the active learning framework concerns the selection of objects for labeling,
  which are used for iteratively updating the underlying model. In this work, an algorithm
  called CoPAL (Conformal Prediction for Active Learning) is proposed, which makes
  the selection of objects within active learning based on the uncertainty as quantified
  by conformal prediction. The efficacy of CoPAL is investigated by considering the
  task of estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of assets in the domain of predictive
  maintenance (PdM). Experimental results are presented, encompassing diverse setups,
  including different models, sample selection criteria, conformal predictors, and
  datasets, using root mean squared error (RMSE) as the primary evaluation metric
  while also reporting prediction interval sizes over the iterations. The comprehensive
  analysis confirms the positive effect of using CoPAL for improving predictive performance.
