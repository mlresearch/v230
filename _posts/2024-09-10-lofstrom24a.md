abstract: Calibrated Explanations is a recently proposed feature importance explanation
  method providing uncertainty quantification. It utilises Venn-Abers to generate
  well-calibrated factual and counterfactual explanations for binary classification.
  In this paper, we extend the method to support multi-class classification. The paper
  includes an evaluation illustrating the calibration quality of the selected multi-class
  calibration approach, as well as a demonstration of how the explanations can help
  determine which explanations to trust.
