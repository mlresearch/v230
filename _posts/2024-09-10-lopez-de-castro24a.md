abstract: Quantifying the stability of feature selection techniques has been an ongoing
  challenge over the last two decades. A large number of stability estimators have
  been proposed to overcome this problem, but performance guarantees based on suitable
  statistical frameworks are lacking. A recently developed framework proposed a new
  and robust estimator of the stability and a method to quantify the uncertainty of
  the estimates through approximate confidence intervals. Unfortunately, this statistical
  framework is based on asymptotic assumptions. In situations in which a low number
  of subsets of selected features are available for the quantification of the stability
  estimator, the coverage guarantees provided by this framework do not hold. In this
  work, we propose a method to estimate stability and achieve validity in a situation
  where only a few samples are available. We take advantage of the Conformal Prediction
  framework, constructing prediction intervals without any assumption about the underlying
  distribution of data. Extensive simulations show that our method successfully achieves
  conservative validity. Furthermore, as the number of available samples increases
  efficiency is also achieved. Comparisons between prediction intervals and confidence
  intervals show an acceptable trade-off between coverage guarantees and the interval
  length for the former, while there is a clear miscoverage for the latter.
