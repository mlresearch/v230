abstract: This study introduces two algorithms based on the Inductive Conformal Martingale
  (ICM) approach to address the change point (CP) detection problem in array-based
  Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) data. The ICM, a distribution-free approach
  with minimal assumptions, is particularly suitable for this application. We have
  implemented two ICM-based algorithms; the first utilizes nonconformities from preprocessed
  data, while the second incorporates the label conditional distribution and the labels’
  distribution to enhance detection accuracy. This approach significantly improves
  our results, demonstrating the potential of ICM in complex genomic data analysis.
