abstract: 'In this paper, we propose \emph{Evidential Conformal Prediction (ECP)}
  method for deep classifiers to generate the conformal prediction sets. Our method
  is designed based on a non-conformity score function that has its roots in Evidential
  Deep Learning (EDL) as a method of quantifying model (epistemic) uncertainty in
  DNN classifiers. We use evidence that are derived from the logit values of target
  labels to compute the components of our non-conformity score function: the heuristic
  notion of uncertainty in CP, uncertainty surprisal, and expected utility. Our extensive
  experimental evaluation demonstrates that ECP outperforms three state-of-the-art
  methods for generating CP sets, in terms of their set sizes and adaptivity while
  maintaining the coverage of true labels.'
